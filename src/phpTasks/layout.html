            A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web
            applications. The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that
            Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to
            how it works. ou can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End
            as server-side. The basic languages for Front-End Development are
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
